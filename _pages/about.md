Iain Whiteside flirts shamelessy with the practical, but he is never happier than when sketching out a proof on a whiteboard.

Iain thinks that third person is a bit silly for a bio.

When not educating fellow San Franciscans about the merits of the word "[faff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faff)" or my [theory on the division of humankind into four categories](../blog/2017/four-categories/), I can be found at NASA Ames Research Center, where I work as a ~~*Rocket*~~ *Computer Scientist*. I work closely with [Ewen Denney](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/edenney/) and [Ganesh Pai](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/gpai/) and, together, we are chipping away at the increasingly important problem of giving a semantics and methodology to [assurance cases](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/dependability/tools/assurancecase/). I am the lead developer of [AdvoCATE](../projects/advocate), our toolset for developing, maintaining, evaluating, and understanding assurance cases.


My first true love was a lady called [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) -- unrequited: she treated me very badly, at times -- and while I no longer think about her every day, she still holds a special place in my heart.

I wrangled a PhD from the University of Edinburgh back in 2013. My thesis, [Refactoring Proof](../assets/pdf/thesis.pdf), has the shortest title of my cohort and five Simon and Garfunkel lyrics hidden in it. It defined, and put on a formal footing, [refactoring](http://www.tech-dojo.org/#!/articles/564326afd862ff0b00ef3cc9) for proof languages in the [interactive theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant) community. With my friend Dominik Dietrich, I made a prototype [implementation](../projects/polar/) of a generic refactoring tool based on bidirectional graph transformations, but it has languished. One day I will get back to it.

As a newly minted Doctor, I post-doc'ed with [Cliff Jones](homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/) at Newcastle University on the [AI4FM project](http://ai4fm.org). Everyone should have Cliff as their boss at some point in their life. Everyone. After another post-doc at Edinburgh University and failing to convince EPSRC that partial functions were important, I dipped my toe in industry.

I professionally developed Domain Specific Languages (and [DSL IDEs](ddk.tools.avaloq.com)), deliriously ranted about [null](https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/), and religiously observed [Fika](https://qz.com/636682/this-four-letter-word-is-the-swedish-key-to-happiness-at-work/) at [Avaloq](https://www.avaloq.com/) for almost a year. 

I have accidentally become an expert in model-driven development, particularly in [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org). It has been a very happy accident. The nascent interest, stemming from practical necessity is quickly becoming (and influencing) the central focus of my research. 

If one were to invent a common thread in all my work, it is that I am devoted to making the lives of software engineers, proof engineers, safety engineers, and humans easier.


I happen to think that we can [teach](http://www.sfmathcircle.org) mathematics a little bit better than we currently do.
