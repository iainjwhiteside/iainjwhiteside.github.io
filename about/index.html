    <p>Iain Whiteside flirts shamelessy with the practical, but he is never happier than when sketching out a proof on a whiteboard.</p>

<p>Iain thinks that third person is a bit silly for a bio.</p>

<p>When not educating fellow San Franciscans about the merits of the word “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faff">faff</a>” or my <a href="../blog/2017/four-categories/">theory on the division of humankind into four categories</a>, I can be found at NASA Ames Research Center, where I work as a <del><em>Rocket</em></del> <em>Computer Scientist</em>. I work closely with <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/edenney/">Ewen Denney</a> and <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/gpai/">Ganesh Pai</a> and, together, we are chipping away at the increasingly important problem of giving a semantics and methodology to <a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu/dependability/tools/assurancecase/">assurance cases</a>. I am the lead developer of <a href="../projects/advocate">AdvoCATE</a>, our toolset for developing, maintaining, evaluating, and understanding assurance cases.</p>

<p>My first true love was a lady called <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle</a> – unrequited: she treated me very badly, at times – and while I no longer think about her every day, she still holds a special place in my heart.</p>

<p>I wrangled a PhD from the University of Edinburgh back in 2013. My thesis, <a href="/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf">Refactoring Proof</a>, has the shortest title of my cohort and five Simon and Garfunkel lyrics hidden in it. It defined, and put on a formal footing, <a href="http://www.tech-dojo.org/#!/articles/564326afd862ff0b00ef3cc9">refactoring</a> for proof languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant">interactive theorem proving</a> community. With my friend Dominik Dietrich, I made a prototype <a href="../projects/polar/">implementation</a> of a generic refactoring tool based on bidirectional graph transformations, but it has languished. One day I will get back to it.</p>

<p>As a newly minted Doctor, I post-doc’ed with <a href="homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/cliff.jones/">Cliff Jones</a> at Newcastle University on the <a href="http://ai4fm.org">AI4FM project</a>. Everyone should have Cliff as their boss at some point in their life. Everyone. After another post-doc at Edinburgh University and failing to convince EPSRC that partial functions were important, I dipped my toe in industry.</p>

<p>I professionally developed Domain Specific Languages (and <a href="ddk.tools.avaloq.com">DSL IDEs</a>), deliriously ranted about <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/">null</a>, and religiously observed <a href="https://qz.com/636682/this-four-letter-word-is-the-swedish-key-to-happiness-at-work/">Fika</a> at <a href="https://www.avaloq.com/">Avaloq</a> for almost a year.</p>

<p>I have accidentally become an expert in model-driven development, particularly in <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>. It has been a very happy accident. The nascent interest, stemming from practical necessity is quickly becoming (and influencing) the central focus of my research.</p>

<p>If one were to invent a common thread in all my work, it is that I am devoted to making the lives of software engineers, proof engineers, safety engineers, and humans easier.</p>

<p>I happen to think that we can <a href="http://www.sfmathcircle.org">teach</a> mathematics a little bit better than we currently do.</p>
