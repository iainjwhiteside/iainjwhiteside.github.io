In early 2016, I was asked to give a talk to Edinburgh-based runners on how to train. This request came at a time of personal disillusionment when I was thinking carefully about the reasons that I run.

The result was a bit more philosophical than the audience was intending, but I get asked for the slides a lot (and it's going to feature in a [book](https://heightsofmadness.com/jonny-muir/) soon!), so [here they are](../../assets/pdf/strava.pdf). 

Sorry about all the in-jokes, you had to be there (or buy me a beer and I'll tell you in person).
