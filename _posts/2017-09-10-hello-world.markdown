I decided, upon embarking on Project Make A Personal Website that all photos on my blog would be comic-book versions of myself. I was informed by 'peer reviewers' that it might be considered "unprofessional" by very many people.

<div class="col three caption">
This happens quite a lot. There is not usually a fire extinguisher handy.
</div>

Instead of letting those (very, very many) hours of fine-tuning Comic-Iain go to waste, they seem like a good first blog post material. My life in four cartoons.

<div class="img_row">
<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/space-iain.jpg">
<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/running-iain.jpg">
<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blackboard-iain.jpg">
</div>
